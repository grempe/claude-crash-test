# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

If you leave this reference here to the logo file found at @hooked-logo.png in this dir claude will crash. If you remove the reference to the png file, or change its name to a non-existant file, claude will start fine. See the output in CRASH.txt

However, It works with a reference to the claude logo I found at @claude-logo.png so it could be something about my exact image? You can leave this one in place and it seems to work.
